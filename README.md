## Notepad Project (notepad-project)

A project by Nick Zuccarelli for testing Vue3/Quasar/JavaScript knowledge for new candidates!


Please do the following when editing this project:

1. Clone the repo to your device
2. Commit the existing contents to a new GitHub repo
3. `npm install` to install all package dependencies
4. `quasar dev` will run a dev server on localhost. Your browser should automatically open
5. Perform any fixes/changes as required (hint: find all usages of "hint" or "todo" to discover some tasks to complete)
6. Give the project your own UI flare! Impress me. You may also choose to extend on some components with extra functionality
7. Commit all your changes in a **single** commit to your forked repo
8. Contact Nick when you're done :)
